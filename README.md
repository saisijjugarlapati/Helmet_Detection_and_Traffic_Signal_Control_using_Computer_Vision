# Helmet_Detection_and_Traffic_Signal_Control_using_Computer_Vision
This project aims to enhance road safety using computer vision by detecting helmetless individuals on two-wheelers through smart cameras and dynamically increasing the time duration for traffic signals. This approach helps in reducing accidents and injuries, ensuring a safer traffic environment.
