## Helmet_Detection_and_Traffic_Signal_Control_using_Computer_Vision
This project aims to enhance road safety by using computer vision to detect helmetless individuals on two-wheelers through smart cameras. The system dynamically extends the duration of traffic signals for those detected without helmets, while their helmet status is displayed on an LED screen. This method encourages helmet use by highlighting violations and promoting compliance, ultimately helping to reduce accidents and injuries for a safer traffic environment.

### Requirements
* urllib3==2.2.2
* pillow==10.4.0
* streamlit==1.37.0
* ultralytics==8.0.196
* Python==3.12.4

### To run the program :
`>>>streamlit run projectUI.py`

I created a simple UI to display the output, which is illustrated in the following images:
### The sequence of the output is shown in these images:
